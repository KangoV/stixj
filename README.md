## TODO

Grab the following from https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-validator/blob/master/stix2validator/v21/enums.py#L133
- IANA Media (MIME) types
- IANA Character Sets
- IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry
- IANA IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Entities

Also, grab the other arrays from the bottom of that file.

Maybe grab the relationship tables
